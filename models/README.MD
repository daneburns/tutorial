# :open_file_folder: [Models](../)
This folder holds the models in the MVC paradigm. The models are responsible for setting up the data-structures we will be working with in our application.

  ## :page_facing_up: index.js
 This is a file generated by the Sequelize package. The env variable can be changed to move deployment from and to the test, development and production databases. This is also where Sequelize will look to the rest of the items in the folder for generating models and associations that will be used in our program.

  ## :page_facing_up: user.js
This is the user model we are creating for our program, that is then built by index.js and Sequelize. This user authentication model is a functionality of passport. There is also two methods. The first method is to compare the password to a hashed version of the password. The second method hashes a created password to ensure we don't store it as plain-text. These are security measures to ensure that the only person who knows their password is the user.
